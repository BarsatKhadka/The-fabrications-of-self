        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Question of Identity</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The first section of "I recalled the memory" raises a profound
          question of identity. It attempts to reveal that we instinctively
          believe someone exists behind all these phenomena of experience.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This pattern of thinking persists because we have been conditioned to
          experience life this way for so long. As the Dhammapada Verse 4 wisely
          notes:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="mb-4 border-l-4 pl-4 italic">
          "He abused me, he ill-treated me, he got the better of me, he stole my
          belongings;"
        </blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Such thoughts continuously arise within our consciousness.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Here we hold a mistaken view of reality according to the Tathagata.
          Here is where the right view [The first of eight noble paths] becomes
          essential. The moment I associate myself with any object of contact, a
          sense of "I" is constructed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These objects of contact can be anything experienced through our six
          senses:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            With the ear, it might be music I hear, leading to "I like this
            music"
          </li>
          <li>
            With the eye, perhaps a beautiful person I see, creating the thought
            "I feel love" - in that moment, a self was fabricated
          </li>
          <li>
            With the tongue, tasting chocolate might trigger "I enjoy this
            flavor" - another instance of self-creation
          </li>
          <li>
            With the body, feeling pain might prompt "I am suffering" -
            reinforcing the illusion of a permanent self
          </li>
          <li>
            With the mind, remembering embarrassment might generate "I feel
            shame" - mistaking a temporary feeling for an identity
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          But what is fueling this contact? Are these sense organs alone capable
          of leading to this great of a wrong view?
        </p>
        
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Thoughts Are Not "Theoretical"</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Applied thought is action. When I get a thought of wanting to listen to a song, one of two conditions follows:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">Condition 1:</p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-4">
          I have access to the internet and electronic devices to play the song—I instantly play it. This demonstrates how thought can transition from seemingly theoretical to concrete reality with remarkable speed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">Condition 2:</p>
        <p className="mb-4 pl-4">
          I do not have access to electronic devices or the necessary conditions that would allow me to listen to music. In this case, the thought remains apparently theoretical. But importantly, it always retains the potential to become real, to manifest practically when conditions align.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This is precisely why we must apply mindfulness to every thought that arises. Even thoughts that seem absurd or insignificant are not merely theoretical—they hold the potential to materialize under the right conditions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When you simply notice that thinking about music and finding it pleasurable can lead you directly to seeking out music, you begin to recognize patterns. Reading and identifying unwholesome patterns before they develop fully will benefit you tremendously in the long run.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Buddha speaks of this as "mental inclination":
        </p>
        <blockquote className="mb-4 border-l-4 pl-4 italic">
          "Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of renunciation, he has abandoned the thought of sensual desire to cultivate the thought of renunciation, and then his mind inclines to thoughts of renunciation."
        </blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Let go of thinking patterns you don't wish to manifest in your life, and gradually results will appear.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When thoughts arise, don't avoid them by redirecting attention to the breath or practicing loving-kindness meditation. Instead, this is precisely the moment to fully investigate what your thoughts are shaping you to become—what mental inclinations they're cultivating.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          "This is not me. This feeling is not me. This sensation is not me. These five aggregates are not me." Think in this way and you disassociate yourself from the illusion of self. Whenever you associate yourself with the "I" within, you're engaging in a pattern of unwholesome thought. Avoid this identification. It is a fire that will cause suffering, because all suffering occurs within the five aggregates.
        </p>
        
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Middle Way in Action</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If there is no self, as stated above, then there are only processes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You may have heard the dream analogy: When you wake up from your dream, you realize that 'you' - the sense of self you felt in the dream - was not you but something fabricated by the mind. If you have ever experienced lucid dreaming, this realization becomes even more profound. You dare to do anything in the dream because you recognize the dream person is not the "real self" you ordinarily identify with.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This raises a profound question: By realizing there is no self in these processes, why follow the five precepts? Why adhere to ethical rules? If you have no self, for whom are these ethical guidelines intended?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I have been putting constant efforts to correct the smallest flaws in my ethical conduct - simple acts like not taking anything that's not given or purchased. I work as a custodian on campus, and my friends hesitate to clean toilets or vacuum because these tasks are intensive. But realizing I have no permanent self, I willingly take on these duties. Yet while doing so, I've often wondered: why would any of this matter if these are just processes with nothing truly associated with "myself"?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Here, the middle way comes to the rescue. The Buddha taught that we should not cling to either extreme: neither the belief in a permanent, unchanging self nor the belief in complete nihilism where nothing matters. Instead, we should recognize the <strong>middle way</strong>: there is no permanent self, but there is still experience, and actions still have consequences and significance.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This middle path is beautifully illustrated in the Kaccayanagotta Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 12.15), where the Buddha addresses this very paradox:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="mb-4 border-l-4 pl-4 italic">
          "This world, Kaccana, for the most part depends upon a duality—upon the notion of existence and the notion of nonexistence. But for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the world. And for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of existence in regard to the world.<br /><br />
          
          "This world, Kaccana, is for the most part shackled by engagement, clinging, and adherence. But one such as this [with right understanding] does not become engaged and cling through that engagement and clinging, mental standpoint, adherence, underlying tendency; he does not take a stand about 'my self.' He has no perplexity or doubt that what arises is only suffering arising, what ceases is only suffering ceasing. His knowledge about this is independent of others. It is in this way, Kaccana, that there is right view."
        </blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The middle way teaches us that while the self is not ultimate or permanent, our actions create causes and conditions that shape experience. Ethical conduct isn't for the benefit of an unchanging self, but rather contributes to the unfolding of experience with less suffering and greater harmony. The absence of a permanent self doesn't negate responsibility—it transforms our understanding of it.
        </p>

        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Fire of Craving</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Let's examine a practical example: Imagine seeing a Chinese celebrity wearing revealing clothes on YouTube.
          Certain processes come into action automatically.
        </p>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-2">A person with wrong view sees this as:</p>
          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            "Himself being attracted to that woman and now wanting her."
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-2">A person with knowledge of dependent origination sees it this way:</p>
          <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <ul className="space-y-2">
              <li className="flex items-center">
                <span className="mr-2">→</span> Sense organ (eye)
              </li>
              <li className="flex items-center">
                <span className="mr-2">→</span> consciousness
              </li>
              <li className="flex items-center">
                <span className="mr-2">→</span> contact (screen)
              </li>
              <li className="flex items-center">
                <span className="mr-2">→</span> feeling ("I like her")
              </li>
              <li className="flex items-center">
                <span className="mr-2">→</span> craving ("I want her")
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Craving is backed up by ignorance if one cannot see that she too is empty of inherent existence. 
          She appears on the screen due to her own karmic formations.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This process is brilliantly illuminated in the Fire Sermon (Adittapariyaya Sutta, SN 35.28):
        </p>

        <blockquote className="mb-6 border-l-4 border-orange-500 pl-4 italic bg-orange-50 p-4 rounded-r">
          "Monks, the eye is burning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, 
          eye-contact is burning, and whatever feeling arises dependent on eye-contact—whether 
          pleasant, painful, or neutral—that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with 
          the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion; burning with birth, 
          aging, and death; with sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair, I say...
          <br/><br/>
          Seeing thus, the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with 
          the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with eye-consciousness, disenchanted 
          with eye-contact."
        </blockquote>

        <p className="mb-4">
          When we see all sensory experience through the lens of dependent origination, 
          we understand that craving arises not because "I" want something, but because 
          conditions have come together to create the experience of desire. By recognizing 
          this process, we can observe craving without identifying with it, allowing the 
          fire to gradually burn itself out.
